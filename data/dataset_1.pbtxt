    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively.

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively.

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

    procedure_details: " The flow reaction system primed by anhydrous toluene at 1 mL min-1 for 10 minutes. The flow was then adjusted to 0.5 mL min-1 during heating. When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively.

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "

When the desired temperature was reached, the flow was then set to the desired rate (Table S1), until the in-line polarimeter showed a stable reading and set to zero. The inlet was then switched to the reagent line, containing (S)-1. The reaction was monitored by the polarimeter, which was used to established when steady state had been achieved (a stable reading). The flow of the reactant was maintained for a further 5 minutes at steady state, during which time 5 samples were collected (1 sample/min). The volume of sample collected will therefore depend on the flow rate i.e., 1/0.7/0.3 mL min-1 = 5 x 1/0.7/0.3 mL samples, respectively. The collected sample were diluted and subject to GC and (chiral) HPLC analysis to determine the product distribution. "
